Of course. You are absolutely right, `create` is part of the `npm` command. My apologies for the confusion. Let's clear that up and get you the right prompts.

You want the command to be `npm create nextblock`. For that to work, the package you publish to npm must be named `create-nextblock`. When a user runs `npm create nextblock`, npm automatically prepends `create-` and looks for the `create-nextblock` package.

Here is the updated step-by-step guide with the correct naming conventions and prompts for your AI assistant.

### Step 1: Create a New Application for the CLI Tool

First, you'll need a new application within your Nx monorepo to house your CLI tool. We will name this application `create-nextblock` to match the package name we'll publish to npm.

**Prompt for your AI assistant:**

```
I need to create a new Node.js application within my Nx monorepo for a CLI tool. The name of the new application should be `create-nextblock`.

Please generate the command to create a new Node.js application using `@nx/node`. The application should be configured for TypeScript.
```

### Step 2: Configure the `package.json` for a CLI Command

Next, you'll need to configure the `package.json` of your new `create-nextblock` application to define the CLI command.

**Prompt for your AI assistant:**

```
I need to configure the `package.json` file located in `apps/create-nextblock/package.json` to make it an executable CLI command.

1.  Add a `bin` field to the `package.json` file. The key should be `create-nextblock` and the value should be the path to the main TypeScript file, which will be `src/main.ts`.
2.  Add a "shebang" line (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) to the top of the `apps/create-nextblock/src/main.ts` file to make it executable.
3.  Add the following dependencies to the `dependencies` in the root `package.json`: `inquirer` for user prompts, `fs-extra` for file system operations, and `chalk` for styling the output. Also add `@types/inquirer` and `@types/fs-extra` to `devDependencies`.
```

### Step 3: Implement the CLI Logic

Now you can start writing the code for the CLI tool. This will involve prompting the user for information and then scaffolding the project.

**Prompt for your AI assistant:**

```
I am building a CLI tool that will be executed with `npm create nextblock`. I need you to write the code for `apps/create-nextblock/src/main.ts`.

The CLI tool should perform the following steps:

1.  **Welcome Message:** Display a welcome message to the user (e.g., "Welcome to NextBlock CMS!").
2.  **Prompt for Project Name:** Use the `inquirer` library to ask the user for the name of their project.
3.  **Create Project Directory:** Create a new directory with the project name provided by the user.
4.  **Scaffold the Project:** Copy the existing `apps/nextblock` directory from the monorepo into the new project directory. This will serve as the template for the new project.
5.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in the new project directory to install all the necessary dependencies. You can use the `execa` library to run shell commands.
6.  **Success Message:** Display a success message to the user with instructions on how to start their new project (e.g., "Your NextBlock project has been created! To get started, run `cd <project-name>` and then `npm run dev`.").

Please provide the complete code for `apps/create-nextblock/src/main.ts`.
```

### Step 4: Testing the CLI Tool Locally

Before publishing to npm, you'll want to test your new CLI tool locally.

**Prompt for your AI assistant:**

```
I have created a CLI tool in my Nx monorepo. I need to know how to test it locally before publishing to npm.

Please provide me with the steps to:

1.  Build the `create-nextblock` application.
2.  Use `npm link` to create a symbolic link to the local package so I can run `create-nextblock` globally on my machine.
```

### Step 5: Publishing to npm

Once you're happy with your CLI tool, you can publish it to npm.

**Prompt for your AI assistant:**

```
I have created a CLI tool called `create-nextblock` and I'm ready to publish it to npm.

Please provide me with the steps to:

1.  Log in to my npm account from the command line.
2.  Publish the `create-nextblock` package to the npm registry.
```

By following these steps, you will have a CLI tool that developers can use by simply running `npm create nextblock`.



That is an incredibly sharp and important question. You've hit on a critical detail of building a scaffolding tool from a monorepo.

You are 100% correct. The simple copy-paste approach is flawed. The new project created by the CLI tool **will be broken** because it is a standalone application and can no longer "see" the `libs` folder from your monorepo.

When your `apps/nextblock` code tries to `import { Button } from '@nextblock-cms/ui'`, it will fail because in the new project, that package doesn't exist locally. It needs to be downloaded from the npm registry like any other package (e.g., React, Next.js).

### The Solution: From Local Libs to Published Packages

For `npm create nextblock` to produce a working project, your shared libraries (`ui`, `utils`, `db`, `editor`, `sdk`) must be treated as real, independent packages.

This means you will need to:

1.  **Publish your libraries (`libs/*`) to npm.** Each library will become its own public package (e.g., `@nextblock-cms/ui`, `@nextblock-cms/utils`).
2.  **Update your CLI tool's logic.** The tool must be smarter. It can't just copy files. It needs to create a new `package.json` for the user's project that lists your published packages as dependencies.

When the user then runs `npm install`, it will download both Next.js and your `@nextblock-cms/ui` package from the npm registry, and everything will work correctly.

### Revised Step-by-Step Guide

Let's revise the plan with this new, more robust logic. First, you'll need to prepare your libraries for publishing.

#### **Step A: Prepare Libraries for Publishing**

**Prompt for your AI assistant:**

```
I need to prepare my Nx libraries (`ui`, `utils`, `db`, `editor`, `sdk`) to be published as public npm packages under the scope `@nextblock`.

For each library in the `libs` directory, please help me:
1.  Ensure its `package.json` has a version number (e.g., "0.0.1").
2.  Add a "publishConfig" field to each library's `package.json` to set the public access, like this:
    "publishConfig": {
      "access": "public"
    }
3.  Generate the command I would use to build all the libraries.
```

*(Note: You would then need to actually publish them by running `npm publish` from their respective build output directories, but the above prompt gets them ready.)*

#### **Step B: Update the CLI Tool Logic (The New Step 3)**

Now, update the prompt for your CLI tool's main file to include this much smarter logic.

**Updated Prompt for your AI assistant:**

```
I am building a CLI tool that will be executed with `npm create nextblock`. I need you to write the code for `apps/create-nextblock/src/main.ts`.

The CLI tool must create a standalone project, not a monorepo. It should perform the following steps:

1.  **Welcome & Prompt:** Greet the user and prompt them for the project name and their preferred package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`).
2.  **Create Directory:** Create the new project directory.
3.  **Copy Template:** Copy the contents of the `apps/nextblock` directory into the new project directory.
4.  **Transform `package.json`:**
    * Read the newly copied `package.json` file.
    * **Set the project name** to the name the user provided.
    * **Clean up dependencies:** In `dependencies`, find all local monorepo packages (those starting with `@nextblock-cms/`) and update their versions to a public-ready version like `"^0.0.1"`.
    * **Clean up scripts:** Remove all `nx`-specific scripts. Add standard Next.js scripts:
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "lint": "next lint"
    * Write the modified `package.json` back to the file.
5.  **Copy Environment File:** Copy the root `.env.example` file into the new project and rename it to `.env.local`, instructing the user to fill it out.
6.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the appropriate install command (`npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install`) in the new project directory.
7.  **Success Message:** Display a success message, reminding the user to update their `.env.local` file and how to start their project.

Please provide the complete code for `apps/create-nextblock/src/main.ts`.
```

This approach is more complex, but it is the **correct** way to build a professional scaffolding tool. It ensures that the project you provide to users is self-contained, functional, and ready to use. Your insight on this was spot on\!
