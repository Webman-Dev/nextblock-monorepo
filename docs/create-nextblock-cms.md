Architectural Blueprint and Implementation Plan for the create-nextblock CLISection 1: The Strategic Imperative: Positioning the CLI as a Growth Engine1.1. From Developer Tool to Strategic Asset: Aligning the CLI with the Product-Led Growth ModelThe development of the create-nextblock Command Line Interface (CLI) tool represents a pivotal milestone in the NextBlock CMS 100-day roadmap. It is the primary technical deliverable of Phase 2, explicitly tasked as "P2: Create Developer CLI Tool (create-cms) for Scaffolding".1 However, its significance extends far beyond being a mere technical utility. This CLI is the cornerstone of the project's entire product-led growth strategy, serving as the principal onboarding vehicle for the developer community and the first tangible expression of the platform's "developer-first" philosophy.3 Its successful implementation is a direct prerequisite for the monetization and ecosystem-building efforts planned for Phases 3 and 4.The overarching business model for NextBlock CMS is predicated on a "Freemium Core + Premium Extensions" strategy, a model proven by successful open-source platforms like WordPress and Strapi.2 This model's efficacy is contingent upon attracting a large and engaged user base for the free, open-source core product. This user base forms the top of the sales funnel, from which a percentage will convert into paying customers for premium modules (such as the planned e-commerce extension) and participants in the third-party block marketplace.4 The create-nextblock CLI is the primary acquisition channel for this essential user base. It is the first point of contact a new developer has with the NextBlock ecosystem, and the quality of that initial interaction will profoundly influence their decision to adopt, explore, and ultimately invest in the platform.In this context, the CLI transcends its role as a simple scaffolding tool and becomes the project's most potent marketing asset. For a developer-focused product, a seamless, intuitive, and rapid setup experience is more persuasive than any blog post or marketing campaign. A frictionless onboarding process, culminating in a fully functional and correctly configured project within minutes, builds immediate trust and goodwill. It validates the project's claims of being a modern, high-performance solution and demonstrates a commitment to an exceptional Developer Experience (DX). This positive first impression is the seed from which community engagement and advocacy grow. Conversely, a CLI that is cumbersome, confusing, or produces a broken or poorly configured project will create insurmountable friction, stalling developer adoption at the outset. If the user base fails to materialize, the audience for premium modules will not exist, and the entire monetization strategy detailed in the business plan will be rendered unviable. Therefore, the pursuit of an impeccable developer experience within the CLI is not a "nice-to-have" feature; it is a critical, foundational business requirement upon which the commercial success of NextBlock CMS depends.1.2. The Developer Experience Flywheel: How a Seamless Onboarding Accelerates Ecosystem AdoptionThe strategic value of the create-nextblock CLI is best understood through the concept of a "Developer Experience Flywheel," a self-reinforcing growth loop that is catalyzed by a superior onboarding process. This virtuous cycle is the engine that will drive the long-term adoption and commercial viability of the NextBlock platform. Investing in the quality and usability of the CLI is a direct investment in accelerating this flywheel.The cycle operates as follows:Seamless Onboarding Attracts Developers: A developer discovers NextBlock CMS and uses npx create-nextblock to start a new project. The process is fast, intuitive, and results in a perfectly configured, running application. This positive initial experience lowers the barrier to entry and encourages the developer to commit to building their project on the platform.Adoption Drives Engagement with the SDK: As the developer builds their application, they become familiar with the core libraries and the platform's architecture. This familiarity naturally leads them to explore the Developer Block SDK, a key deliverable of Phase 2 designed to empower developers to create custom blocks and extensions.2SDK Engagement Seeds the Marketplace: Empowered by the SDK, a segment of these developers will create their own custom blocks, themes, and plugins. The business plan's vision for a third-party marketplace provides a powerful incentive for this creation, offering a channel for developers to share or sell their extensions.4A Rich Marketplace Increases Platform Value: As the marketplace grows with high-quality, third-party extensions, the overall value proposition of the NextBlock CMS platform increases exponentially. The availability of a rich ecosystem of add-ons makes the platform more powerful and versatile, capable of addressing a wider range of use cases.Increased Value Attracts More Developers: This enhanced platform value, amplified by the social proof of a vibrant community, attracts a new wave of developers to the ecosystem. Their journey, in turn, begins at the first step: using the create-nextblock CLI to start a new project.This flywheel illustrates how the initial developer experience is not an isolated event but the kinetic trigger for a powerful network effect. The CLI is the primary point of entry into this cycle. A well-executed CLI ensures the flywheel starts spinning with minimal friction, while a poorly designed one would prevent it from ever gaining momentum. The commission revenue from the marketplace and direct sales of premium modules, as outlined in the business plan, are the financial outcomes of this flywheel's sustained motion.41.3. Defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Future Extensibility PathIn adherence with the user's directive, the immediate priority is the delivery of a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that validates the core technical challenges of the CLI. The scope of this MVP is precisely defined: to scaffold a minimal, standalone Next.js project that has the five core @nextblock-cms libraries installed and is correctly configured to connect to a user's existing database.The decision to explicitly defer the creation of polished starter templates and database seeding scripts is a strategically sound application of agile development principles. This approach prioritizes the highest-risk and most technically complex aspect of the project first: the automated integration and configuration logic. This logic, which involves programmatically modifying package.json, tailwind.config.ts, tsconfig.json, and other core files, is the foundational mechanic of the CLI. By focusing on proving this core functionality, the project ensures that the most difficult engineering problems are solved before investing time in lower-risk, content-oriented features like templates. This de-risks the development process and guarantees that the CLI's foundation is robust and reliable.While the focus is on the MVP, the CLI's internal architecture must be designed with future extensibility in mind. The 100-day roadmap clearly indicates a future requirement for "Starter kits/Project Templates (Blog, Docs)".1 The CLI's architecture should therefore be modular, allowing for the easy addition of command-line flags such as --template blog or --with-seeds in subsequent development phases. This foresight ensures that the initial MVP is not a technical dead-end but a solid foundation upon which the full vision of the tool can be built, aligning with the long-term goal of providing developers with powerful and flexible starting points for their projects.Section 2: Functional Specification and User Journey2.1. The End-to-End User Flow: From Invocation to a Running ApplicationThe user journey for the create-nextblock CLI is designed to be as simple and efficient as possible, mirroring the best-in-class experience provided by industry-standard tools like create-next-app and create-t3-app.5 The entire process, from terminal invocation to a running local development server, should take no more than a few minutes.The detailed flow is as follows:Invocation: The user opens their terminal and runs the command npx create-nextblock@latest my-nextblock-app. The @latest tag ensures they are always using the most recent version of the CLI. The project name (my-nextblock-app) is provided as an argument.Interactive Prompts: If any required information is missing (e.g., the project name was not provided), the CLI will present a series of simple, interactive prompts to gather the necessary details. This includes confirming the project name and selecting a preferred package manager.Project Scaffolding: Upon confirmation, the CLI begins the scaffolding process. It will create a new directory with the specified project name.Foundation Generation: The CLI will programmatically invoke the official create-next-app tool to lay down a standard, best-practice Next.js project structure within the new directory. This ensures the base of the project is always up-to-date with the latest Next.js conventions.7Configuration Transformation: Once the base project is created, the CLI executes a series of automated scripts to transform the boilerplate into a NextBlock CMS project. This includes:Modifying the package.json to add the five core @nextblock-cms library dependencies.Configuring tailwind.config.ts and globals.css to correctly integrate with the @nextblock-cms/ui library.Generating a .env.example file with the necessary variables for Supabase and R2 connectivity.Replacing the default page.tsx and layout.tsx with minimal templates that confirm the successful integration.Dependency Installation: The CLI will detect the user's chosen package manager (or the one they have installed) and automatically run the install command (e.g., npm install, yarn, pnpm install). A spinner will be displayed to provide feedback during this potentially lengthy step.Git Initialization: The CLI will initialize a new Git repository in the project directory and make an initial commit of all the generated files.Success and Next Steps: Upon successful completion, the CLI will display a clear success message. This message will congratulate the user and provide the essential next steps: how to navigate into the project directory, populate the .env file, and start the development server. The final output will guide the user to a running, functional Next.js application on http://localhost:3000.2.2. Designing the Interactive Experience: Command Structure, Arguments, and User PromptsThe CLI's public API—its commands, arguments, and flags—must be clear, predictable, and adhere to common command-line conventions. The interactive prompts will be designed for clarity and brevity, using a library like inquirer to provide a polished user experience.8The following table provides a formal specification for the CLI's interface, serving as a definitive guide for implementation and documentation.Table 2.1: CLI Command and Option SpecificationCommand/Argument/OptionTypeDescriptionDefaultcreate-nextblockCommandThe main executable command invoked via npx.N/A<project-directory>ArgumentThe name of the directory to create for the project. If omitted, the user will be prompted.Interactive Prompt--use-npmFlagExplicitly use npm as the package manager for dependency installation.Auto-detect or Prompt--use-yarnFlagExplicitly use yarn as the package manager for dependency installation.Auto-detect or Prompt--use-pnpmFlagExplicitly use pnpm as the package manager for dependency installation.Auto-detect or Prompt--use-bunFlagExplicitly use bun as the package manager for dependency installation.Auto-detect or Prompt--skip-installFlagSkip the automatic installation of dependencies after scaffolding.false-y, --yesFlagSkip all interactive prompts and proceed with default values.falseThe interactive prompts for the MVP will be minimal and focused:Project Name: What is your project named?... my-app (This prompt is skipped if the project directory is provided as an argument).Package Manager: Which package manager would you like to use? › npm | yarn | pnpm | bun (The CLI should attempt to auto-detect the user's preferred package manager but provide an override).Confirmation: A final summary and confirmation prompt before any files are written to the disk, ensuring the user can review their choices.2.3. The Anatomy of the Scaffolded Project: Defining the Final File and Directory StructureThe final output of the CLI must be a clean, well-organized, and idiomatic Next.js project. The structure should be immediately familiar to any developer with Next.js experience, facilitating a smooth transition from scaffolding to active development.9 This "definition of done" serves as a clear target for the scaffolding process.Table 2.2: Generated Project File Structure (MVP)my-app/

Section 3: Architectural Design of the CLI Tool3.1. The "Wrapper and Transformer" Pattern: Orchestrating create-next-app for a Robust FoundationThe core architectural decision for the create-nextblock CLI is to adopt a "Wrapper and Transformer" pattern. This approach avoids the significant and unnecessary complexity of building a Next.js project scaffolder from the ground up. Instead, the CLI will leverage the official, Vercel-maintained create-next-app tool as its foundation and then apply a series of targeted modifications.The process will unfold in two distinct stages:Wrapping (Foundation Stage): The CLI will first programmatically execute the create-next-app command (e.g., npx create-next-app@latest my-app --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir).5 This initial step generates a pristine, standard, and up-to-date Next.js project boilerplate. It ensures that the scaffolded project adheres to all current best practices, file structures, and dependency versions as defined by the Next.js team.Transformation (Configuration Stage): Immediately following the successful completion of create-next-app, the CLI will execute a series of internal scripts. These scripts will act as "transformers," surgically modifying the generated boilerplate to inject the specific configurations required for the NextBlock CMS ecosystem. This includes adding dependencies, configuring Tailwind CSS, generating environment files, and replacing placeholder pages.This architectural pattern offers a profound strategic advantage by de-risking the project and ensuring its long-term maintainability. The complex and ever-evolving task of maintaining a compliant Next.js project structure is entirely offloaded to the Vercel team. When Next.js introduces new features, updates its configuration, or changes its directory structure, the create-next-app tool is updated accordingly. The create-nextblock CLI automatically benefits from these updates in its foundation stage. The maintenance burden is thus reduced to ensuring that the transformation scripts remain compatible with the latest create-next-app output. This is a far more manageable and less error-prone task than maintaining an entire custom scaffolder. This pattern allows development effort to be focused precisely on the CLI's unique value proposition: the expert configuration and seamless integration of the NextBlock CMS libraries, rather than reinventing the wheel of basic project scaffolding.3.2. Core Technology Stack: Leveraging commander, inquirer, and fs-extra for a Modern CLITo build a robust, user-friendly, and maintainable CLI, a carefully selected stack of Node.js libraries is required. The selection is based on industry best practices and the specific needs of a modern command-line tool.8commander.js: This library will be used for all command-line argument and option parsing. It provides a declarative API for defining commands, handling user input, and automatically generating helpful --help text. Its widespread adoption and stability make it the ideal choice for managing the CLI's public interface.inquirer.js: For the interactive parts of the user journey, inquirer.js will be employed. It offers a rich set of prompt types (input, list, confirm) that create a far more intuitive and guided experience for the user than simple command-line flags alone. This is critical for gathering user preferences, such as the choice of package manager.fs-extra: All file system operations will be handled by fs-extra. It extends the native Node.js fs module with additional, convenient methods like readJson, writeJson, copy, and ensureDir. These methods simplify the complex file manipulation tasks required during the transformation stage, leading to cleaner and more readable code.chalk: To enhance the readability and user experience of the terminal output, chalk will be used. It allows for the simple application of colors and styles to console messages, which can be used to distinguish between informational messages, warnings, errors, and success notifications, making the CLI's output easier to parse at a glance.3.3. Internal Project Structure: Organizing the CLI for Maintainability and ScalabilityThe internal structure of the create-nextblock package itself will be organized for clarity, maintainability, and future scalability. A logical separation of concerns will ensure that as new features (like additional templates or configuration options) are added, the codebase remains easy to navigate and modify.8The proposed directory structure is as follows:create-nextblock/
├── bin/
│   └── create-nextblock.js  # The executable script, containing the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node`.
├── src/
│   ├── commands/              # Contains the core logic for the main `create` command.
│   │   └── create.ts
│   ├── lib/
│   │   └── transformers.ts    # Functions that perform specific modifications (e.g., modifyPackageJson).
│   ├── templates/             # A directory for static template files to be copied.
│   │   ├── layout.tsx.hbs
│   │   └── page.tsx.hbs
│   └── utils/                 # General-purpose helper functions.
│       ├── cli.ts             # Functions for rendering prompts and messages.
│       └── filesystem.ts      # Wrappers around fs-extra for file operations.
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
3.4. Templating and File Generation StrategyThe CLI will employ a hybrid strategy for creating and modifying files in the target project, choosing the most robust method for each task.Static Templating with Minimal Interpolation: For files that require significant new content or have a completely different structure from the create-next-app defaults (such as src/app/layout.tsx and src/app/page.tsx), the CLI will use template files. These files will be stored in the src/templates/ directory. A lightweight templating engine like Handlebars (.hbs extension) might be used if minimal variable interpolation (e.g., inserting the project name) is required. The CLI will read these templates, perform any necessary interpolations, and then write the final files to the target project directory, overwriting the originals.Programmatic Modification of Data Structures: For configuration files that require small, precise changes (package.json, tailwind.config.ts), a programmatic approach is far more reliable than simple string replacement or regex.For JSON files (package.json), the CLI will use fs-extra to read the file into a JavaScript object, manipulate the object's properties directly (e.g., adding keys to the dependencies object), and then write the modified object back to the file, preserving formatting.For JavaScript/TypeScript configuration files (tailwind.config.ts), a more advanced approach using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser like recast or jscodeshift may be employed. This allows the CLI to parse the code into a tree structure, programmatically add new elements (e.g., a presets property to the exported object), and then regenerate the code from the modified tree. This method is highly robust and resilient to formatting changes or comments in the original file.Section 4: Automated Project Configuration and Integration Logic4.1. Prerequisite: Publishing the Core Shared Libraries to the NPM RegistryA critical, non-obvious prerequisite for the create-nextblock CLI to function is the public availability of the core NextBlock CMS libraries. The current monorepo architecture utilizes internal TypeScript path aliases, such as @nextblock-monorepo/ui and @nextblock-monorepo/db, for seamless code sharing within the development workspace.11 These internal paths are meaningless to a new, standalone project generated by the CLI. For an external project to consume these libraries, they must be treated as standard third-party dependencies, which necessitates publishing them to a public package registry like NPM.This represents a fundamental strategic step: bridging the gap between the internal monorepo development environment and the external developer's standalone project environment. Before the CLI can be fully implemented, an NPM organization must be established (e.g., @nextblock-cms) 12, and the shared libraries from the libs/ directory must be packaged and published under this scope. This action transforms them from internal modules into distributable, versioned software packages that any Node.js project can install and use. The CLI's primary configuration task will then be to inject these public packages as dependencies into the newly scaffolded project.The recommended public package names are:@nextblock-cms/ui@nextblock-cms/utils@nextblock-cms/db@nextblock-cms/ecommerce (initially a placeholder package)@nextblock-cms/sdk (initially a placeholder package)4.2. Programmatic Dependency Management: Modifying package.json to Inject Core LibrariesOne of the CLI's primary transformation tasks is to programmatically modify the package.json file generated by create-next-app. This script will be responsible for injecting the core NextBlock CMS libraries as dependencies.The automated process is as follows:The CLI will use fs-extra.readJson to parse the package.json file into a JavaScript object.It will then access the dependencies property of this object.The script will add the five core @nextblock-cms/* packages as new key-value pairs to the dependencies object.Finally, it will use fs-extra.writeJson to write the modified object back to the package.json file, ensuring proper formatting is maintained.The following table specifies the exact dependencies to be added. A caret (^) versioning strategy is recommended to allow users to automatically receive non-breaking updates to the core libraries.Table 4.1: Core Library Package Dependencies and Versioning StrategyPackage NameVersionTypeRationale@nextblock-cms/ui^1.0.0dependencyProvides the core, shared UI components based on shadcn/ui, ensuring a consistent design system.11@nextblock-cms/utils^1.0.0dependencyContains essential shared utilities like the cn function for class names and environment variable validators.11@nextblock-cms/db^1.0.0dependencyThe centralized data access layer for all Supabase client logic and database interactions.11@nextblock-cms/ecommerce^1.0.0dependencyA placeholder for the future premium e-commerce module, included to establish the architectural pattern.11@nextblock-cms/sdk^1.0.0dependencyA placeholder for the future public developer SDK, establishing the foundation for the third-party ecosystem.114.3. TypeScript Integration: Generating a tsconfig.json for a Standalone EnvironmentThe create-next-app tool provides a robust, default tsconfig.json file that is well-suited for a modern Next.js application. For the MVP of the create-nextblock CLI, no significant modifications to this file are required. The published @nextblock-cms/* NPM packages will be compiled to JavaScript and will include their own TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts). When these packages are installed in the node_modules directory, the TypeScript compiler will automatically discover and use these type definitions, providing full type safety and editor autocompletion without any additional configuration in the project's tsconfig.json. The CLI's responsibility is simply to ensure that a valid tsconfig.json exists, which is guaranteed by the "Wrapper and Transformer" pattern.4.4. UI and Styling Configuration: A Deep Dive into Automating tailwind.config.ts and globals.cssThis is the most intricate transformation step, requiring precise modifications to integrate the @nextblock-cms/ui library correctly. The automation must replicate the two-file Tailwind configuration pattern used within the monorepo, adapted for a standalone project consuming the UI library from node_modules.11tailwind.config.ts Modification:The CLI will programmatically modify the tailwind.config.ts file generated by create-next-app.AST Parsing: The script will parse the file's content into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).Content Path Injection: It will navigate the AST to find the content array within the exported configuration object. It will then add a new string literal to this array: "./node_modules/@nextblock-cms/ui/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}". This crucial step instructs Tailwind to scan the installed UI library's files, ensuring that any CSS classes used by the components are included in the final purged stylesheet.Preset Configuration: The script will add a presets property to the configuration object. This property will be an array containing an import of the Tailwind preset from the UI library, for example: presets: [require('@nextblock-cms/ui/tailwind-preset')]. This preset file, published as part of the @nextblock-cms/ui package, will contain the entire shared theme configuration (colors, spacing, typography, etc.), ensuring visual consistency.globals.css Modification:The CLI will completely overwrite the default src/app/globals.css file. The new content will be sourced from a template that mirrors the global stylesheet from the monorepo's UI library.11 It will contain:Base Tailwind Directives: The three essential Tailwind directives that inject the base styles, component classes, and utility classes.CSS@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
CSS Variables for Theming: Any root-level CSS variables required for the shadcn/ui theming system (e.g., colors, border-radius) will be defined, ensuring that components from @nextblock-cms/ui are styled correctly out of the box.4.5. Database Connectivity: Generating the .env.example and Integrating the @nextblock-cms/db LibraryTo facilitate a smooth setup for database connectivity, the CLI will generate a .env.example file in the root of the new project. This file serves as a template, guiding the developer on which environment variables are required to connect the application to their backend services. The required variables are determined by the project's core dependencies: Supabase for the database and authentication, and Cloudflare R2 for object storage, as established in the project roadmap and architecture.3 The @nextblock-cms/db library relies on these variables to initialize its clients.Table 4.2: Required Environment Variables for .env.exampleVariable NameDescriptionExample ValueNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URLThe unique URL for your Supabase project, found in your project's API settings.https://<project-ref>.supabase.coNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEYThe public, anonymous key for your Supabase project, used for client-side access.ey...R2_ACCOUNT_IDYour Cloudflare account ID, found in the R2 dashboard.a1b2c3d4e5f6...R2_ACCESS_KEY_IDThe Access Key ID for an R2 API token with appropriate bucket permissions....R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEYThe Secret Access Key for the corresponding R2 API token....R2_BUCKET_NAMEThe exact name of the R2 bucket designated for media and asset storage.nextblock-cms-mediaNEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URLThe public-facing URL for accessing assets in the R2 bucket, often via a custom domain.https://media.yourdomain.com4.6. Bootstrapping the Application: Templating layout.tsx and page.tsx for Out-of-the-Box FunctionalityTo provide immediate visual feedback and confirm that all configuration steps were successful, the CLI will replace the default src/app/layout.tsx and src/app/page.tsx files with custom templates.layout.tsx Template: This template will be minimal but functional. Its primary role is to import the newly configured globals.css file, ensuring that the Tailwind styles and CSS variables are applied to the entire application. It will render the standard <html> and <body> tags and include the {children} prop within the body, adhering to Next.js App Router conventions.page.tsx Template: This template serves as the final, crucial validation step. It will be a simple React component that performs two key actions:It will import a component, such as <Button>, directly from the newly installed @nextblock-cms/ui package.It will render this component with some text. For example:TypeScriptimport { Button } from '@nextblock-cms/ui';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to NextBlock CMS</h1>
      <Button>Get Started</Button>
    </main>
  );
}
When the user starts the development server, the successful rendering of this styled button will visually confirm that the entire toolchain is working correctly: the @nextblock-cms/ui dependency was installed, TypeScript path resolution is functioning, and the Tailwind CSS integration is applying the correct styles.Section 5: A Phased Implementation Roadmap for the AI AssistantTo ensure a structured and methodical development process, the construction of the create-nextblock CLI will be broken down into four distinct, sequential phases. This roadmap provides a clear path for the AI assistant, with each phase building upon the last and having a well-defined set of deliverables.5.1. Phase 1: CLI Skeleton and Command ParsingThe initial phase focuses on establishing the basic structure and user interface of the CLI application itself. The goal is to create a functional, executable Node.js script that can parse commands and interact with the user, without yet performing any file system operations.Task 1: Project Initialization: Initialize a new Node.js project for the CLI tool. Configure package.json, setting the type to "module" for ES Module support and defining the bin field to link the create-nextblock command to the executable script.Task 2: Install Core Dependencies: Install the essential CLI development libraries: commander, inquirer, chalk, and fs-extra.Task 3: Implement Command Structure: Using commander, define the main command, its arguments (e.g., <project-directory>), and all specified options (e.g., --use-npm, --skip-install). Implement the basic help text generation.Task 4: Develop Interactive Prompts: Using inquirer, create the interactive prompts for gathering the project name and preferred package manager. Implement the logic to use command-line arguments as defaults and skip prompts when the --yes flag is used.5.2. Phase 2: Implementing the Core Scaffolding EngineThis phase implements the "Wrapper" part of the architectural pattern. The objective is to have the CLI successfully generate a default Next.js project in the specified directory.Task 1: Develop Command Execution Utility: Create a robust utility function that can execute external shell commands (like npx) asynchronously, stream their output to the user's console in real-time, and handle any potential errors gracefully.Task 2: Integrate create-next-app: Implement the core logic that constructs and executes the full create-next-app command, passing along the necessary flags (--ts, --tailwind, etc.) and the user-provided project name.Task 3: Implement Git Initialization: After the scaffolding is complete, add the logic to initialize a Git repository and create an initial commit.5.3. Phase 3: Developing the Configuration Automation ScriptsThis is the most critical phase, focusing on the "Transformer" logic. Each task involves writing a self-contained script that modifies a specific part of the newly scaffolded project.Task 1: Create package.json Transformer: Write the function that reads the package.json file, programmatically adds the five @nextblock-cms/* dependencies, and writes the file back.Task 2: Create Tailwind CSS Transformer: Develop the script to modify tailwind.config.ts. This may involve using an AST parser to reliably inject the content path and presets configuration. Additionally, implement the logic to overwrite src/app/globals.css with the correct base styles.Task 3: Create Environment File Generator: Write the function that creates the .env.example file and populates it with the required variables for Supabase and R2.Task 4: Implement Template Copying: Create the template files for layout.tsx and page.tsx. Write the utility function that copies these templates from the CLI's internal templates/ directory to the appropriate locations in the target project, overwriting the default files.5.4. Phase 4: End-to-End Testing and RefinementThe final phase integrates all components and focuses on ensuring the reliability and quality of the final output.Task 1: Assemble the Main Workflow: In the main command handler, orchestrate the execution of all previously developed functions in the correct sequence: prompt user, run create-next-app, apply all transformation scripts, install dependencies, and initialize git.Task 2: Develop and Automate E2E Tests: Implement the end-to-end testing strategy as detailed in Section 6.1. This test should be added as a script to the CLI's package.json and integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.Task 3: Refine User Experience: Perform multiple end-to-end runs of the CLI. Refine the wording of prompts, improve the clarity of status messages and error handling, and ensure the final output is polished and professional.Section 6: Recommendations for Testing, Publishing, and Long-Term Maintenance6.1. A Robust Testing Strategy for the CLITesting a scaffolding tool presents unique challenges. Simple unit tests are insufficient because the ultimate measure of success is the integrity of the generated project. Therefore, a multi-layered testing strategy, heavily weighted towards end-to-end (E2E) validation, is essential.Unit Testing: While not the primary focus, unit tests are valuable for isolating and validating the logic of specific, pure functions within the CLI. Good candidates for unit testing include the utility functions responsible for programmatically modifying JSON objects or parsing arguments. These tests ensure that the core building blocks of the transformation scripts behave as expected.Integration and End-to-End Testing (Primary Strategy): The most critical form of testing will be an automated E2E script that simulates the entire user journey and validates the output. This script should be a core part of the CI/CD pipeline and must be executed before any new version of the CLI is published. The E2E test workflow will be:Execution: The test runner will execute the CLI's bin script programmatically (e.g., node./bin/create-nextblock.js my-test-app --yes --skip-install) to generate a new project in a temporary directory.Structural Verification: The script will assert that the generated file structure matches the expected output defined in Table 2.2. It will check for the existence of key files like tailwind.config.ts and .env.example.Content Verification: The script will read the content of the modified configuration files (package.json, tailwind.config.ts) and assert that the NextBlock CMS-specific additions are present and correct.Dependency Installation: The test will then navigate into the newly created project directory and run the package manager's install command (e.g., npm install).Build Validation: This is the ultimate validation step. The script will execute the production build command (npm run build). A successful build (exit code 0) provides a high degree of confidence that all dependencies were correctly injected, TypeScript is configured properly, type definitions are resolvable, and Tailwind CSS paths are valid. A failed build immediately signals a regression in the scaffolding logic.6.2. Versioning and Publishing create-nextblock to NPMTo make the CLI accessible to the public and manage its evolution, a disciplined approach to versioning and publishing is required.Semantic Versioning (SemVer): The CLI must strictly adhere to the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specification.13MAJOR version (X.y.z) will be incremented for incompatible API changes (e.g., removing a command-line flag or changing the core architecture).MINOR version (x.Y.z) will be incremented for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner (e.g., adding a new optional flag for a template).PATCH version (x.y.Z) will be incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes (e.g., fixing an issue in the Tailwind configuration script).NPM Publishing: The process for publishing the package to the public NPM registry involves several key configuration steps 15:package.json Configuration: The name field should be set to create-nextblock. The bin field is critical; it must map the command name to the executable script file (e.g., "bin": { "create-nextblock": "./bin/create-nextblock.js" }). This is what allows the npx command to find and execute the tool.Authentication: The maintainer must be logged into an NPM account via the npm login command.Publishing Command: The package is published using the npm publish --access public command.Automation: The publishing process should be automated via a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) that triggers on the creation of a new Git tag, ensuring that every published version corresponds to a specific, immutable point in the source code history.6.3. Future Roadmap: Incorporating Starter Templates and Extensibility HooksUpon the successful delivery and validation of the MVP, the CLI's architecture is well-positioned for future expansion, directly aligning with the post-MVP goals outlined in the 100-day roadmap.1The most logical next step is the implementation of starter templates. The CLI can be extended to support an --example or --template flag, mirroring the functionality of create-next-app.5 This feature would allow users to scaffold more complete, feature-rich starting points, such as a pre-built blog or a documentation site. The implementation would involve modifying the CLI to fetch the specified template from a remote repository (e.g., a dedicated folder within the main NextBlock CMS GitHub repository). The CLI would clone this template and then apply the same transformation logic to inject user-specific configurations and dependencies. This approach provides a clear and scalable path for enriching the onboarding experience and further accelerating developer productivity within the NextBlock CMS ecosystem.
