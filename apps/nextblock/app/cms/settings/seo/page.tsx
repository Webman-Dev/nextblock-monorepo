/**
 * The SEO operations screen: which URLs moved, and what crawlers are allowed to do.
 *
 * ADMIN-only, and gated here as well as in every action and in RLS. The gate is
 * repeated rather than delegated because the three layers protect different things:
 * this one stops a WRITER from ever seeing the screen (a redirect list is a map of a
 * site's history, and the robots block is a map of what it is hiding), the actions
 * stop a hand-rolled request that never loaded the page, and RLS stops everything
 * else. `requireAdminSupabaseClient` throws, which is the right behaviour for a
 * Server Component: an unauthorised visitor gets the error boundary instead of a
 * half-rendered admin screen.
 *
 * The two reads run concurrently because they are independent — one hits
 * `cms_redirects`, the other one row of `site_settings` — and running them in series
 * would add a whole round trip to a screen that is already behind an auth check.
