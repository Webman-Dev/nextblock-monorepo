 * Exchange a mailed thread link for a session cookie, then get the token out of the URL.
 *
 * This redirect is the most important control in the whole feature. The app sends
 * `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, which means the FULL url travels in
 * the Referer header on same-origin navigations — so a token left in the address bar
 * would leak to every internal link the visitor clicks, into browser history, into any
 * screenshot they share, and into proxy access logs. Held in an HttpOnly cookie it does
 * none of that, and script on the page cannot read it either.
 *
 * Every failure lands on the same token-less page with no cookie set. The visitor is
 * never told which kind of failure it was: distinguishing "expired" from "never existed"
 * would turn this route into an oracle.
