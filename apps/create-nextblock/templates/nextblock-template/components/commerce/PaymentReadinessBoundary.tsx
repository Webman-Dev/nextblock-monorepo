 * Supplies payment readiness to the buy controls beneath it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT mounted in the root layout: readiness is only consulted by buy CTAs
 * and the checkout, so a blog post or a landing page should not pay for the lookup. Each
 * commerce block renderer wraps itself in this instead, which also means nested cases
 * (a product grid inside a section) are covered without anyone having to walk the block
 * tree looking for them.
 *
 * getStoreReadiness() is request-cached, so several of these on one page cost one read.
 * Any failure yields no readiness at all, and the context default ("everything ready")
 * keeps a working store working.
