/**
 * The live SEO audit that sits beside the Tiptap canvas.
 *
 * Three constraints shaped everything in this file.
 *
 * First, **the audit is deterministic and local**. Every number on screen comes
 * from `@nextblock-cms/utils/seo`, a pure dependency-free engine that runs in
 * the browser. No model is consulted to produce a score, which is what makes it
 * safe to re-run while someone is typing: it costs nothing, it cannot fail, and
 * it cannot disagree with itself between two runs over the same text. The only
 * network call in this component is the explicit, user-initiated "Fix with
 * Cortex AI" click.
 *
 * Second, **typing must never stutter**. `NotionEditor` calls `useEditor`
 * without `shouldRerenderOnTransaction`, so Tiptap does not re-render this
 * subtree on keystrokes; what does change on every keystroke is the `content`
 * prop, arriving through the block editor's own state. Auditing on each of those
 * would parse the whole document per character. The recompute is therefore on a
 * trailing 300 ms debounce, and documents past `SEO_LIVE_AUDIT_MAX_CHARACTERS`
 * are not audited live at all — a 400k-character document is pathological, and
 * freezing the tab to grade it would be a worse outcome than declining to.
 *
 * Third, **the panel knows nothing about how it is mounted**. It receives the
 * content string, an optional editor instance and the Cortex AI activation flag
 * as props, because `libs/editor` cannot import application code and the CMS
 * cannot reach into the editor's internals. The editor arrives via the
 * `onEditorReady` prop added to `NotionEditor` rather than through the legacy
 * `window.__nextblockEditor` global, which races whenever two editors mount.
 *
 * Note on metadata: `metaTitle` and `metaDescription` are forwarded to the
 * engine exactly as received, because the engine distinguishes `undefined`
 * ("this caller is not auditing metadata") from `null` or `''` ("the field
 * exists and is blank", which is a finding). Defaulting them here would invent
 * two failures every caller that only edits body copy is powerless to fix.
 *
 * Fourth, added after the first release: **the panel has a scope, and it says so
 * out loud**. The original version was only ever mounted inside a rich-text
 * block, where it graded one paragraph as though it were the whole page and
 * reported "no H1" and "fewer than 300 words" — neither of which is a property a
 * single block can have. The engine now takes a `scope`, and this component
 * takes two mutually exclusive sources for the text it grades: `content`, one
 * block's stored string, or `document`, a `SeoDocument` the caller has already
 * assembled from every block on the page. Whichever arrives is passed straight
 * through with the scope, and the header names the scope so a block score can
 * never be mistaken for the page score.
