/**
 * The request contract for the alt-text endpoint.
 *
 * `z.strictObject` rather than `z.object`, for the same reason the rest of the
 * Cortex surface uses it: an unknown key is almost always a caller that has drifted
 * from the contract — a stale client still sending `mediaId`, or a hand-rolled
 * fetch that guessed at the field names — and silently discarding it produces a
 * generation that ignores half of what the caller asked for. Rejecting loudly at
 * the boundary turns that into a 400 the developer can actually read.
 *
 * `maxLength` is validated only for shape (a positive integer), not for range. The
 * engine in `ai-vision.ts` deliberately CLAMPS an out-of-range budget into its own
 * 20..1000 bounds instead of throwing, precisely so that a careless call site
 * cannot break a media upload flow; duplicating those bounds here would both
 * contradict that decision and leave two copies of the same numbers free to drift
 * apart.

/**
 * Return a human-readable reason the supplied image URL cannot be sent to a vision
 * model, or `null` when it is usable.
 *
 * This duplicates a check that `generateCortexAiAltText` also performs, and it does
 * so deliberately. The engine's copy throws, which would surface here as a 500 —
 * the status code that means "the server broke" — when the truth is that the caller
 * sent an unusable value and needs a 400 telling them exactly that. Running the
 * check first gives the common mistake the right status and an actionable message,
 * while the engine keeps its own guard for every other call site.
 *
 * The mistake being guarded against is concrete rather than hypothetical:
 * `resolveMediaUrl()` returns a bare `/${objectKey}` whenever no R2 base URL is
 * configured, so an install that has not finished its media setup hands every
 * caller a site-relative path. Because the Cortex OpenRouter provider is created
 * without `supportedUrls`, the AI SDK does not forward a link to the model — it
 * downloads the image server-side and inlines it as base64 — so a relative path
 * would fail inside the SDK's own fetch, once per model in the fallback chain, with
 * an error that never mentions the actual problem.
 *
 * The scheme test is strict rather than allowlist-based: any absolute URL is
 * acceptable as long as it is http or https, but `file:`, `data:`, and `blob:` are
 * refused. Those are the schemes that would either read the server's own disk or
 * push an unbounded inline payload through every model in the fallback chain.
